==================
GitHub Tissues Ops for managing GitHub repositories by raising Tissues.

## Getting Started
1. Choose one of the options below.
2. Fill out the details for your repository or team.
3. Wait for approval from a member of **SRE  Engineering**.

<br><br>
[![Create Repo]](https://github.com/abcdef/GitHubs/Tissues/new?assignees=&labels=administration%2Ccreaterepo&projects=&template=createrepo.yml)  
**NOTE:** *You will need to know the correct Development team (GitHub Team/Entra group), that will own this repository.*
<br><br><br>
[![Archive Repo]](https://github.com/abcdef/GitHubs/Tissues/new?assignees=&labels=administration%2Carchiverepo&projects=&template=archiverepo.yml)  
**NOTE:** *If we are decommissioning a production component, (regardless of what that component is), that the repo is linked to, then this will need a Change Request to be raised (either Standard or Normal depending on the relative risk of the component).*
<br><br><br>
[![Create Team]](https://github.com/abcdef/GitHubs/Tissues/new?assignees=&labels=administration%2Ccreateteam&projects=&template=createteam.yml)  
**NOTE:** *An Entra ID group needs to match the Team requested. Please do not request this until you have discussed with a member of the SRE  Engineering team.*
<br><br><br>
You can view existing Tissues using the `Tissues` tab in this repo.
